## About

The robot-wrist is a robot that (tries to) mimic the movement of a human wrist
(and forearm). In addition to developing the robot itself, it also was 
integrated with a 3D printer and a PS4 controller to demonstrate a usage case.

Furthermore, it is the final project of the discipline of Microprocessed Systems
taught by Professor Ricardo Jardel Nunes da Silveira from the Federal University
of Cear√° (UFC).
